"""
The "red alert that keeps popping until you respond" mechanism from the
design: a persistent, disk-backed queue of drafted-but-unsent emails, plus
a reviewer loop that keeps re-surfacing anything still pending.

A real deployment would push this as a mobile notification; that needs a
notification service and a always-on backend, which is out of scope for a
course project. A polling CLI loop that won't let you ignore a pending
approval is the honest, buildable version of the same guarantee: nothing
gets sent without you seeing it, and it won't let you forget it's waiting.
